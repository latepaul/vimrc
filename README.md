#    Welcome to Paul's Vimrc File
 
How to set up this vimrc:
 
1. Make sure you have ~/.vim/doc and ~/.vim/bundle directories
2. Copy this file to ~/.vimrc
3. Install Vundle, i.e.
 * cd ~/.vim/bundle
 * git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git
4. Put vimutil on your PATH (e.g. ~/bin)
5. First time in vi run :PluginInstall to install plugins, later from time to time :PluginUpdate to update them

That's it (I think)
